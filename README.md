A discord bot written in Pycord for the Teamagers discord server. 
Designed to supersede "Teamagers Bot" with newer API features (slash commands, UI elements).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher

## Setup
This bot isn't really intended for self hosting, but it is still entirely possible if you so choose.

1. Install dependencies using `python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file containing a `BOT_TOKEN` variable
3. Alter `config.py` to your use case
